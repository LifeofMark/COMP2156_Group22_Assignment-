DevOps is important in the software development life cycle because it helps teams build, test, and release software in a faster and more organized way. It brings developers and system administrators together so they can work as one team instead of separately. This makes communication better and helps avoid delays during development.
With DevOps practices like automation, continuous integration, and monitoring, teams can find problems earlier and fix them quickly. This helps create more stable software, allows faster updates, and improves overall system performance. Because of this, DevOps has become an important part of modern software development.
